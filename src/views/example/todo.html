    <h2>Todo</h2>
    <p class="alert alert-warning">
        Now that you have your project running and you've gotten comfortable with jspm, modules and the
        module loader, it's time to add some additional helper tasks making it easier to
        output your application.
    </p>
    <h4>Production Server</h4>
    <p>
        The most common server is probably <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a>. It has excellent support
        and examples can be found rather easily. You may also want to take a look at <a href="">KOA</a> it was
        written by the same developer that contributed to Express mentioned above. It has gained ground of
        late and makes great use of generators.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://expressjs.com/starter/hello-world.html">Express</a> - hello world example.</li>
        <li><a href="http://koajs.com/#application">KOA</a> - hello world example.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Production Bundling</h4>
    <p>
        Bundling your project for production and deployment is made easy with jspm. Running the follow from your
        terminal or console will clean your dist directory and bundle the project which would be equivalent to
        running <code>$ jspm bundle-sfx app/app app.js</code> directly using the <strong>jspm cli</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the below is completed you're ready to deploy your <strong>/dist</strong> directory to your
        procuction environment.
    </p>
    <pre>
        $ gulp prod
    </pre>
    <h4>Sass & Styling</h4>
    <p>
        One of the best things to add to your workflow is to add Sass for your styling.
        Sass works particularly well for complex layouts. It makes your source more readable
        not to mention powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below is an example of what a gulp.task may look like for your styles. NOTE: this assumes you are using the
        <strong>gulp-load-plugins</strong> module. What this module does is look in your package.json and any module
        prefixed with <strong>gulp-</strong> it exposes to your gulpfile.js. If you do not wish to use this module
        simply require the Sass module which would be <code>var sass = require ('gulp-sass')</code>
    </p>
    <pre>
        gulp.task('styles', function () {<br/>
        &nbsp;gulp.src(['./path/to/src/*.sass])<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;.pipe(plugins.sass())<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;.pipe(gulp.dest('./path/to/dist');<br/>
        });
    </pre>
